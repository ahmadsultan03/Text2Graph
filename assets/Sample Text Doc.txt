Tesla, Inc., founded in 2003 by engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company headquartered in Palo Alto, California. Elon Musk joined the company shortly after its founding, investing $6.5 million and becoming its largest shareholder. He later assumed the role of CEO and product architect.

Tesla’s primary products include electric vehicles like the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y, as well as energy solutions such as the Powerwall and Solar Roof. The company also operates Gigafactories in Nevada, Shanghai, Berlin, and Texas to scale production globally.

In 2021, Tesla surpassed a market valuation of $1 trillion, becoming the sixth company in U.S. history to achieve this milestone. The company competes with other automakers like Ford, General Motors, and newer entrants like Rivian and Lucid Motors.

In addition to Tesla, Elon Musk also leads SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company. SpaceX, headquartered in Hawthorne, California, develops rockets and spacecraft, notably the Falcon 9 and Starship, to enable space exploration.

Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.
